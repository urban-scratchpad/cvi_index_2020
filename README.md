Note: GitHub has a file size limit (100 MB(?)) that prevents sharing large datasets via a repository. Therefore, larger data files are compressed to .zip files, and the large files added by upload initially moved to the [Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fxJZS2yaPqwwSvRPjUdmN-D1fN6vojZX).
